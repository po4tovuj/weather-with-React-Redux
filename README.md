### `some description`

All of this work took near 24 hours, because i didn't work with Redux before, and most of time it was took to read documentation and watch a few videos for understandig how i need to use it and what's the difference between Redax and Vuex .

I was adding setTimeout in action getWeather because data from API comes too fast, and with adding Timeout i want to show that loader is working.

Sorry styles.
